[ FAQ ]
```
Q: How do I change the game images?
A: Open the Game View -> *Game Info* tab -> *Change ID* and put an ID from [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/). Then Save and wait a little.
- To find an ID on SteamGridDB, search the name of the game, open its page, and then copy the numbers at the end of the game page link. 
- Example: The number 666 from the link "https://www.steamgriddb.com/game/666" for the game "Land of Dread"
